  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: August 17, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Whisper: Sentinel Zero</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") 
    collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Whisper: Sentinel Zero is designed with privacy first. The app does <strong>not</strong> collect, 
    store, or share personally identifiable information (PII) without your consent.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voice Input:</strong> Your voice commands are processed locally on your device. No recordings are sent to external servers without your permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Cloud Mode:</strong> If you enable online features, some data (e.g., text queries) may be sent securely to external AI services for processing. This is always optional.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous, non-identifiable technical data (such as app version or crash logs) to improve performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use information solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide app functionality (voice recognition, AI responses).</li>
    <li>Improve stability and performance.</li>
    <li>Offer optional cloud-based features when explicitly enabled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information. 
    Data is only shared with trusted third-party services when you enable specific features, 
    and always under secure encryption.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take your privacy seriously. All local processing stays on your device. 
    When optional cloud requests are made, they are encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You control your data. You may:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the app entirely offline.</li>
    <li>Clear app data at any time in your device settings.</li>
    <li>Choose whether or not to enable online features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect 
    personal data from children. If you believe we have, please contact us.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted 
    here with the new effective date.
  </p>
